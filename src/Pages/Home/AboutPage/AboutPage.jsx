      <p className="py-6 text-xl">Inventory tracking can be time-consuming for many small and medium-sized businesses. QuickBooks helps you effectively manage your stock, so you always know what you have and what you need before you even need it.As stock comes in and out, QuickBooks’ stock inventory management software auto-updates your inventory. This makes it easy to see what’s selling and what you need to order. As the value of your stock changes, so does your balance sheet. Values will automatically adjust throughout the day.</p>
